# who is this?

ü§®
Hello! My name is Danny and I live in the secretly gorgeous city of [Omaha, NE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska). I have 4 siblings (2 boys, 2 girls) and love the piano and singing. I'm a HUGE theater nerd üé≠üíÉ.

## so what's your blog about?

Good Q. I mostly write about new and cool technology, some math, and soon, the analysis of some classical/baroque music. Just whatever knowledge I want to share üëç

## work

Currently, I am working on an "Ebay" for selling college or boarding school items at the end of the year with a couple others from Exeter (in New Hampshire), as the Lead Software Developer.

Formerly _Technical Intern_ and _Software Developer Intern_ at [Gallup, Inc.](https://gallup.com) Before that, I worked as a _Cybersecurity Intern_ at [UNO](https://unomaha.edu).
